# SPI
OpenCore SPI RTL is verified using COCOTB.
## Running the Tests
### To run Individual Tests:
  **make TESTCASE=<Name_of_TestCase>**  
 Note: Name_of_TestCase can be found in test_spi.py like `async def <<name>>`.Here, name is the TestCase Name

 ### Generate Code Coverage 
  - Ensure coverage.dat is generated. This can be generated by changing CVG_EN as 1 in Makefile.  
  - After the above step, enter the below commands
    ```
       verilator_coverage -write-info coverage.info coverage.dat
       genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage
    ```
    New Directory called coverage is created where **index.html** shows the coverage report.
